    <h1>My hobbies</h1>
      <article>My whole reason for living has been about finding a meaning to what we call life. One of the many ways I seem to do that is by expressing myself through my hobbies whome i love very much. Some of my hobbies include: </article>
      <h3>Boxing</h3>
      <h3>Swimming</h3>
      <h3>Hiking</h3>

        <p>Boxing has been in my life since I can remmeber.Almost everyone in my family boxes so sometimes I have a lot off pressure being the best I can be but over I love the sport. Swimming is another hobby I love doing I love the fun and freeness you feel yet your actually working out. Hiking is another thing I can't live without. Sometimes I dont even hike to work out but enjoy the walk itself. Sometimes i lose myself in hikes just admiring the beauty and love of the forrest.</p>
